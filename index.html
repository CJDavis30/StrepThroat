        <p>Information about everything you need to know about strep throat.</p>
        
        <h2>How/Where?</h2>
        <p>Strep throat is caused by the bacterium <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>. While it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it first appeared, Streptococcus bacteria have been infecting humans for centuries. The first detailed descriptions of strep-related diseases date back to the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Infections occur when pyogenes enters the body through the mouth, nose, or breaks in the skin. It spreads easily in crowded environments, through close contact, or through respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.</p>
        <p>Strep throat is a naturally occurring bacteria that has existed in the human population for a long time. It primarily lives in the throat and skin of humans and can be carried without symptoms. It likely originated from human-to-human transmission over generations.</p>
        
        <h2>How Does the Disease Spread?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Person-to-Person Contact</b> – Through saliva, nasal secretions, or direct skin contact.</li>
            <li><b>Airborne Transmission</b> – Coughing or sneezing releases bacteria into the air.</li>
            <li><b>Contaminated Surfaces</b> – Touching objects (e.g., doorknobs, utensils) with the bacteria and then touching the face.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Sore throat (often severe and sudden)</li>
            <li>Pain when swallowing</li>
            <li>Red and swollen tonsils (sometimes with white patches)</li>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Swollen lymph nodes in the neck</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
            <li>Nausea or vomiting (especially in children)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Antibiotics</b> – Usually penicillin or amoxicillin, which reduce symptoms and prevent complications.</li>
            <li><b>Pain Relievers</b> – Acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever and throat pain.</li>
            <li><b>Rest & Hydration</b> – Drinking fluids and getting enough rest help recovery.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Statistics & Survival Rate</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Recovery Rate</b> – Nearly 100% with antibiotics.</li>
            <li><b>Complications</b> – If untreated, strep throat can lead to conditions like rheumatic fever, scarlet fever, or kidney inflammation.</li>
            <li><b>Fatal Cases</b> – Death from strep throat itself is extremely rare but can occur in cases of invasive GAS infections.</li>
        </ul>
